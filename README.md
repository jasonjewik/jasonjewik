### Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm so glad you've decided to stop by.

Some quick things about me...
- 🤖 I'm learning about machine learning
- 💻 I like to work on projects involving frontend/backend stuff
- 📚 I enjoy reading books on tech-related topics like data privacy, labor and tech, and beneficial AI
- ⛏ My personal favorite editor is VS Code, but I'll also use Emacs sometimes
