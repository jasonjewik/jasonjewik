## Hello there! 👋
Me in three bullet points:
- 💻 I am the primary maintainer of [ClimateLearn](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn) and [PhenoCamSnow](https://pypi.org/project/phenocam-snow/).
- 📝 My favorite courses of grad school so far are Quantum Programming and Computability & Complexity Theory.
- 📚 In my free time, I cook and play video games. I'm really enjoying [Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ) right now.

If you would like to contact me, please send an email to `jason DOT jewik AT gmail`.
