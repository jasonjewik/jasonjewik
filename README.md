### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Me in four bullet points:
- ðŸ¤– I spend a decent amount of time doing ML stuff, but I also like software engineering, embedded systems, etc.
- ðŸŒ± I am thinking about ways we can use tech to fight climate change
- ðŸ”¨ My editor of choice is VS Code, but I'll also use emacs and I'm trying to master vim
- ðŸ“š I enjoy reading non-fiction books (see my website for my recent reads!)

If you would like to contact me, please send an email to jason DOT jewik AT gmail.
