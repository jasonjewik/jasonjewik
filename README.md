### Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm so glad you've decided to stop by.

Me in four bullet points:
- 🤖 I am a student of machine learning, especially interested in CV and RL right now
- 🌱 I am thinking about ways we can use tech to fight climate change
- ⛏ My personal favorite editor is VS Code, but I'll also use Emacs sometimes
- 📚 I enjoy reading non-fiction books (see my website for my recent reads!)

If you would like to contact me, please send an email to jason DOT jewik AT gmail. Thanks! (●'◡'●)
