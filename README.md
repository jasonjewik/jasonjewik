## Hello there! 👋
Me in a few bullet points:
- 💼 I work on AI agents at [Box](https://box.com).
- 💻 During graduate school, I built [ClimateLearn](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn) and [PhenoCamSnow](https://pypi.org/project/phenocam-snow/).
- ✈️ My most recent vacation was to Spain and Portugal. I saw the [Alhambra](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Alhambra_(Civ6)) and the [Torre de Belém](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Torre_de_Bel%C3%A9m_(Civ6)); and I enjoyed a wonderful fado show plus dinner at [Estaca Zero in Lisbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/17jwppRGTtByAddU6) (they're a small, family-owned restaurant: highly recommend!)
- 📖 Some recent reads that I especially enjoyed are [_Why Nations Fail_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12158480-why-nations-fail); [_Guns, Germs, and Steel_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel); and [_Poverty, by America_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61358638-poverty-by-america).
